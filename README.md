### [MatterHub](https://github.com/GreenVolume/humhub-themes-MatterHub)
MatterHub is a [WIP] at the moment and we have no idea when we'll actually release the full theme to the public, might end up being our first project to be submitted into Humhub's Marketplace in the future.

### [MadeHub](https://github.com/GreenVolume/humhub-themes-MadeHub)
MadeHub is a theme that isn't 100% to normal standards when it comes to themes with Humhub, as it doesn't use the normal call-to default menu but uses a customized menu that must be added manually to the main.php code.

### [FlatHub](https://github.com/GreenVolume/humhub-themes-flathub)
FlatHub is a project that was started by another person and we just made sure that it was compatiable with v1.1.2 of Humhub.

### [Basic Red](https://github.com/GreenVolume/basicred-humhub-theme)
Humhub Default theme in Red

### [Discord Blue](https://github.com/GreenVolume/humhub-discordblue-theme)
Humhub Default theme in Discord Blue

### [GitHum](https://github.com/GreenVolume/humhub-githum-theme)
GitHum is a HumHub theme based on GitHub's new color scheme.
